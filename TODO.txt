Features
========
-Activate containers when clicking their frame
    -Needs a proper click handling system for frame elements

-Proper monitor frame functionality
    -Correct text sizing and alignment using parent width
    -Taskbar icon popup

-GUI-driven include / exclude configuration

-Theme options for GUI colours, fonts

-Wrap focus around monitors when navigating

-Built-in dmenu-like functionality

-Github-driven auto update using URlDownloadToFile and https://github.com/:owner/:repo/zipball/:branch

-Placeholder GUI windows
    -Take WinTitle as a member variable, wait for it and convert into window container using hwnd

-Layout save/restore

-Check for existing window of same process and insert adjacent when adding new window containers to the tree
    -To fix UE4 opening the editor on the currently active workspace rather than the one the splash appeared on
    -The splash closes before the editor is opened, so this will need a window history setup. Complex.

-Floating window move/resize hotkeys

-Vim-like marks

-Window position/size interpolation option
    -Lerp window into work area

-Window throw gesture
    -Derive velocity from mouse position over time and add offset to window position on drag release

Fixes
=====
-Unify container / layout implementation
    -Workspaces can be achieved with a horizontal tab container
        -Set workspace hotkeys to find the inner/outermost (depending on shift modifier) tabbed layout parent and switch its active child
    -Single container class? Maybe not, but layout (workspace, split) can be simplified to a single implementation

-Proper sorting for workspaces within monitor

-Fix window frame top border being 0 for vertical split children with index > 1

-Fix custom workspace names becoming associated with different monitors
    -How to fix if the OS' internal monitor names change without warning?
    -Tie to monitor position relative to primary?
        -Could tie in to a monitor navigation refactor, grid system?

-Fix taskbar becoming managed under some circumstances
    -WIP, rewrote window filtering
    -If it still doesn't work, it means windows are losing their title or class temporarily
        -Fix by checking each window container for exclusion and destroying if needed?

-More robust monitor config change detection
    -Check monitor index against name
    -Preserve hierarchy by moving existing monitors, add / remove others as needed

-More robust monitor-to-monitor navigation
    -Need a solution that doesn't assume monitors are laid out ie=mcn a linear fashion
    -Remove root container split, offload navigation logic to root

-Check window for min/max size in WindowContainer, center in work area rather than aligning top-left
    -Should allow for nicer management of fixed-size windows like the UE4 splash
    -Won't work with pre-sized windows that don't enforce size, add as window config option?
        
-Revisit undocking / implicit split behaviour (ex. 2V containing a 2H and 1W, try to move child of 2H upward, doesn't turn 2V into a 3V)

-Fix floating windows not responding to moving via keyboard

-Fix certain windows causing windows key to fall through and activate the start menu
    -Reproducible with RemotePC client window
    -Seems to be down to the way RemotePC hooks the windows key

Other
=====
-Create logo with semitransparent background for exe icon

-Fix README.md formatting
