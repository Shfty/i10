Fixes
=====
-Check against current frame title/color to avoid re-setting and making the UI flicker

-Prevent windows from being manually maximized

-Fix splits leaving their frame at the top of the monitor when self-destroying

-Frame / work area support for tab/stack layouts

-Fix broken behaviour when moving current fullscreen window to a different workspace

-Check window for min/max size in WindowContainer, center in work area rather than aligning top-left
    -Should allow for nicer management of fixed-size windows like the UE4 splash

-Jitter / flicker on all but one workspace
    -Happens intermittently when switching away from a workspace
        -All but the source workspace start flickering
        
-Revisit undocking / implicit split behaviour (ex. 2V containing a 2H and 1W, try to move child of 2H upward, doesn't turn 2V into a 3V)

-Fix window drag not taking split creation into account
    -Refactor split creation to happen on press rather than window spawn
        -Use WindowContainer with GUI placeholder until HWND is assigned

-More robust monitor-to-monitor navigation
    -Need a solution that doesn't assume monitors are laid out in a linear fashion
    -Remove root container split, offload navigation logic to root

-Fix floating windows not responding to moving via keyboard

-Fix frames obscuring windows when clicked

-Fix inability to navigate away from ConEmu
    -Seems JOSH-DEV specific

-Fix certain windows causing windows key to fall through and activate the start menu
    -Reproducible with RemotePC client window
    -Seems to be down to the way RemotePC hooks the windows key

-Fix README.md formatting
