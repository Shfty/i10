Fixes
=====
-Fix monitors sometimes being incorrectly reordered inside the root
    -Triggered by oculus software startup/shutdown?

-Check for existing window of same process and insert adjacent when adding new window containers to the tree
    -Should fix UE4 opening the editor on the currently active workspace rather than the one the splash appeared on

-Fix broken behaviour when moving current fullscreen window to a different workspace

-Check window for min/max size in WindowContainer, center in work area rather than aligning top-left
    -Should allow for nicer management of fixed-size windows like the UE4 splash
        
-Revisit undocking / implicit split behaviour (ex. 2V containing a 2H and 1W, try to move child of 2H upward, doesn't turn 2V into a 3V)

-More robust monitor-to-monitor navigation
    -Need a solution that doesn't assume monitors are laid out in a linear fashion
    -Remove root container split, offload navigation logic to root

-Fix floating windows not responding to moving via keyboard

-Fix certain windows causing windows key to fall through and activate the start menu
    -Reproducible with RemotePC client window
    -Seems to be down to the way RemotePC hooks the windows key

-Fix README.md formatting
