Fixes
=====
-Rename title bars to better reflect their role
    -Container visualizer?
-Title bar / work area support for tab/stack layouts
-Jitter / flicker on all but one workspace
    -Happens intermittently when switching away from a workspace
        -All but the source workspace start flickering
-Prevent certain floating popups from being given a title bar
-Revisit undocking / implicit split behaviour (ex. 2V containing a 2H and 1W, try to move child of 2H upward, doesn't turn 2V into a 3V)
-Fix window drag not taking split creation into account
    -Refactor split creation to happen on press rather than window spawn
        -Use WindowContainer with GUI placeholder until HWND is assigned
-More robust monitor-to-monitor navigation
    -Need a solution that doesn't assume monitors are laid out in a linear fashion
    -Remove root container split, offload navigation logic to root
-Account for nested splits when calculating gap size
    -Currently only windows take gap size into account, so splits get extra space
    -Use GetAdjacentWindowX/Y to determine whether a border should be shown?
-Move managed windows to the bottom of the z-order instead of setting popups to always on top
    -Can this be instant using window event hooks?
-Fix floating windows not responding to moving via keyboard
-Fix title bars obscuring windows when clicked
-Fix inability to navigate away from ConEmu
    -Seems JOSH-DEV specific
-Fix certain windows causing windows key to fall through and activate the start menu
    -Reproducible with RemotePC client window
    -Seems to be down to the way RemotePC hooks the windows key
-Fix README.md formatting
